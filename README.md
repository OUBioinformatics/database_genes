# database_genes
Develop a database for user-chosen genes, use the database in bioinformatics programs. 
Each database will have its own doi in github for reference.
Chose your own gene of interest, make a folder.
We will work on the techniques together but apply them separately to our gene of interest.
We will need guidance from Boris.
